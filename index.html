  <h1>MiMirror – Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
  <p><em>Last updated: 15 July 2025</em></p>

  <h2>1. Acceptance of These Terms</h2>
  <p>By downloading, installing, or using MiMirror (“<strong>App</strong>”), you (“<strong>User</strong>”) agree to be bound by these Terms &amp; Conditions (“<strong>Terms</strong>”) and all applicable laws and regulations. If you do not agree, you must not use the App.</p>

  <h2>2. Eligibility &amp; Trader Information</h2>
  <p>The App is offered by dev indie, an individual developer registered with Apple’s App Store as a trader under Articles&nbsp;30 &amp;&nbsp;31 of the EU Digital Services Act (DSA). You must (i) be at least 13&nbsp;years old (or the age of digital consent in your jurisdiction) and (ii) have legal capacity to enter into a contract to use the App.</p>

  <h2>3. License to Use</h2>
  <p>Subject to these Terms, dev indie (“<strong>Developer</strong>”) grants you a limited, non‑exclusive, non‑transferable, revocable licence to use the App for personal, non‑commercial purposes on Apple‑branded devices you own or control.</p>

  <h2>4. Camera &amp; Device Permissions</h2>
  <p>The App accesses the front‑facing camera solely to display your real‑time image; no photos, videos, or biometric data are stored or transmitted off your device. Adjusting the virtual light frame may increase screen brightness—avoid extended use in dark environments and maintain a safe viewing distance.</p>

  <h2>5. Advertising &amp; In‑App Purchases</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Free Tier:</strong> Displays third‑party ads via Google AdMob. Ad content is provided by Google and its partners; Developer is not responsible for the accuracy or legality of ads. AdMob may collect device identifiers and usage data to serve personalised or contextual ads.</li>
    <li><strong>One‑Time Purchase (“Pro Upgrade”):</strong> Removes ads and unlocks additional lighting colours (Warm, Cold, Neutral). The purchase is a non‑consumable In‑App Purchase processed through Apple. All sales are final except as required by local law or Apple's refund policies.</li>
    <li><strong>Restoration:</strong> You may restore prior purchases on any device signed‑in with the same Apple ID.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Privacy &amp; Data Processing</h2>
  <p><strong>Personal Data Collected:</strong> Device identifiers, usage analytics, and advertising data (via AdMob). No facial images or camera footage leave your device.</p>
  <p><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>CCPA/CPRA (California):</strong> California residents may exercise rights to know, delete, and opt‑out of “sale” or “sharing” of personal information.</li>
    <li><strong>State Privacy Laws: </strong> We comply with applicable state privacy laws including those in Virginia, Colorado, and Connecticut.</li>

  </ul>
  <p><strong>Consent Management:</strong> On iOS 14.5+, you will be prompted to allow or deny tracking for personalised ads in compliance with Apple's App Tracking Transparency framework.</p>
  <p><strong>Data Retention:</strong> Analytics and advertising identifiers are kept for up to 26 months (Google default) unless you reset or delete them earlier; aggregated, de‑identified analytics may be retained longer.</p>
  <p><strong>Third‑Party Services:</strong> Google AdMob and Google Analytics for Firebase. Their privacy practices are available at google.com/policies/privacy.</p>

  <h2>7. User Conduct</h2>
  <p>You agree not to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>reverse‑engineer, decompile, or copy the App;</li>
    <li>interfere with servers or networks;</li>
    <li>use the App for unlawful, harmful, or harassing purposes;</li>
    <li>circumvent, remove, or modify any security or technological protection measures.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>All trademarks, service marks, graphics, and code in the App are owned by Developer or its licensors. You obtain no ownership rights by using the App.</p>

  <h2>9. Health &amp; Safety Disclaimer</h2>
  <p>MiMirror is <strong>not</strong> a medical or safety device, nor a substitute for a physical mirror. Excessive screen brightness may cause eye strain or discomfort; use responsibly and discontinue use if adverse symptoms occur.</p>

  <h2>10. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
  <p>THE APP IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON‑INFRINGEMENT. Your use is at your sole risk.</p>

  <h2>11. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, DEVELOPER SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR DATA, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY. IN JURISDICTIONS THAT DO NOT ALLOW SUCH LIMITATIONS, LIABILITY IS LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF (i)&nbsp;US&nbsp;$10 OR (ii)&nbsp;THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE APP IN THE PAST 12&nbsp;MONTHS.</p>

  <h2>12. Indemnification</h2>
  <p>You agree to indemnify and hold Developer harmless from any claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from your (a)&nbsp;breach of these Terms, (b)&nbsp;misuse of the App, or (c)&nbsp;violation of any law or third‑party rights.</p>

  <h2>13. Termination</h2>
  <p>Developer may suspend or terminate your licence at any time for violation of these Terms or to comply with legal requirements. Upon termination, you must cease all use and delete the App.</p>

  <h2>14. Governing Law &amp; Dispute Resolution</h2>
  <p>Except where prohibited, these Terms are governed by the laws of the <strong>United Mexican States</strong> without regard to conflict‑of‑law rules. All disputes shall be resolved exclusively in the competent courts of Mexico City. Consumers in the EU/UK retain any mandatory rights to bring proceedings in their country of residence.</p>

  <h2>15. Changes to These Terms</h2>
  <p>Developer may modify these Terms at any time. Material changes will be announced in‑App or via the App Store “What’s New” notes. Continued use after changes take effect constitutes acceptance.</p>
