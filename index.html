    <h1>MiMirror – Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: 9&nbsp;October&nbsp;2025</em></p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of These Terms</h2>
    <p>By downloading, installing, or using MiMirror (“<strong>App</strong>”), you (“<strong>User</strong>”) agree to be
        bound by these Terms &amp; Conditions (“<strong>Terms</strong>”) and all applicable laws and regulations. If you
        do not agree, you must not use the App.</p>

    <h2>2. Eligibility &amp; Developer Information</h2>
    <p>The App is offered in the United States and Latin America by Eric Vega, an individual developer. You must
        (i)&nbsp;be at least&nbsp;13 years old (or the digital‑consent age in your country) and (ii)&nbsp;have legal
        capacity to enter into a contract to use the App.</p>

    <h2>3. License to Use</h2>
    <p>Subject to these Terms, Eric Vega (“<strong>Developer</strong>”) grants you a limited, non‑exclusive,
        non‑transferable, revocable license to use the App for personal, non‑commercial purposes on Apple‑branded
        devices you own or control. These Terms and Conditions supplement—and do not replace—the Licensed Application
        End
        User License Agreement (Apple Standard EULA) provided by Apple Inc. If any provision of this document conflicts
        with the Apple Standard EULA, the Apple Standard EULA shall govern to the extent of that conflict. See <a
            href="https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/">apple.com/legal/.../stdeula/</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Camera &amp; Device Permissions</h2>
    <p>The App accesses the front‑facing camera solely to display your real‑time image; no photos, videos, or biometric
        data are stored or transmitted off your device. Adjusting the virtual light frame may increase screen
        brightness—avoid extended use in dark environments and maintain a safe viewing distance.</p>

    <h2>5. Advertising &amp; In‑App Purchases</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Free Tier:</strong> Displays third‑party ads via <a
                href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543">Google AdMob</a>. Ad content is provided by
            Google and its partners; Developer is not responsible for the accuracy or legality of ads. AdMob may collect
            device identifiers and usage data to serve personalised or contextual ads.</li>
        <li><strong>One‑Time Purchase (“Pro Upgrade”):</strong> Removes ads and unlocks additional lighting colours
            (Warm, Cold, Neutral). The purchase is a non‑consumable In‑App Purchase processed through Apple. All sales
            are final except as required by local law or Apple's refund policies.</li>
        <li><strong>Restoration:</strong> You may restore prior purchases on any device signed‑in with the same Apple
            ID.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>6. Refund Policy</h2>

    <p>All purchases made through the Apple App Store are subject to Apple's
        refund policies. Users may request refunds directly from Apple by
        following the procedures outlined at <a href="https://support.apple.com/118223">support.apple.com/118223</a></p>

    Important Notes:
    <ul>
        <li> Consumable purchases (virtual coins, single-use items) are generally
            not eligible for refunds</li>
        <li> Developer does not process refunds directly</li>
        <li> All refund requests must be submitted through Apple's official channels</li>
        <li> Refunds are granted at Apple's sole discretion</li>
    </ul>
    For questions about refunds, please contact Apple Support directly.

    <h2 id="privacy">7. Privacy Policy &amp; Data Processing</h2>
    <p><strong>No data collection by Developer.</strong> The App itself does not collect, store or share any
        personal information.</p>
    <p><strong>Third‑party ads.</strong> Ads are served by Google AdMob, which may collect device identifiers and
        usage information to show contextual or personalised ads. This data is processed in accordance with Google’s
        <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> and <a
            href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543">AdMob Help Center</a>.
    </p>
    <p>The Developer does not have access to or control over the data collected by AdMob. For information on how
        Google uses data from sites or apps that use its services and how to opt‑out of personalised advertising,
        visit <a
            href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites">policies.google.com/technologies/partner‑sites</a>.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Opt‑out options:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>U.S. State Privacy Rights:</strong> Toggle “Do Not Sell/Share My Personal Information” in the App’s
            privacy settings to request non‑personalised ads.</li>

        <li><strong>Other regions:</strong> You can reset your device’s advertising identifier and limit ad‑tracking
            in iOS Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Tracking.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. User Conduct</h2>
    <p>You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>reverse‑engineer, decompile, or copy the App;</li>
        <li>interfere with servers or networks;</li>
        <li>use the App for unlawful, harmful, or harassing purposes;</li>
        <li>circumvent, remove, or modify any security or technological protection measures.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>All trademarks, service marks, graphics, and code in the App are owned by Developer or its licensors. You obtain
        no ownership rights by using the App.</p>


    <h2>10. Health &amp; Safety Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>MiMirror is <strong>not</strong> a medical or safety device, nor a substitute for a physical mirror. Excessive
        screen brightness may cause eye strain or discomfort; use responsibly and discontinue use if adverse symptoms
        occur.</p>

    <h2>11. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>THE APP IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT
        NOT LIMITED TO MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON‑INFRINGEMENT. Your use is at
        your sole risk.</p>

    <h2>12. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, DEVELOPER WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT,
        INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, USE, GOODWILL,
        OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. EXCEPT FOR LIABILITY THAT CANNOT
        BE LIMITED BY LAW (INCLUDING, WHERE APPLICABLE, FRAUD, WILLFUL MISCONDUCT, GROSS NEGLIGENCE, OR PERSONAL
        INJURY), DEVELOPER’S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE APP WILL NOT
        EXCEED THE AMOUNTS (IF ANY) YOU PAID TO DEVELOPER FOR THE APP AND IN-APP PURCHASES DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS
        PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM (OR THE EQUIVALENT IN LOCAL CURRENCY). DEVELOPER DOES NOT GUARANTEE
        UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE SERVICE. This limitation applies to all theories of liability (contract, tort,
        statute, or otherwise) and survives termination of these Terms. Some jurisdictions in Latin America do not allow
        certain limitations; where prohibited, this clause applies only to the extent permitted by applicable
        consumer-protection laws.</p>

    <h2>13. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold Developer harmless from and against any and all claims, damages,
        liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs) arising from or relating
        to your: (a) breach of these Terms; (b) misuse of the App; (c) violation of any applicable law or regulation;
        (d) violation of any third-party rights; or (e) negligent acts or omissions while using the App.</p>

    <h2>14. Termination</h2>
    <p>Developer may suspend or terminate your licence at any time for violation of these Terms or to comply with legal
        requirements. Upon termination, you must cease all use and delete the App.</p>

    <h2>15. Governing Law &amp; Dispute Resolution</h2>
    <p>Except where prohibited, these Terms are governed by the laws of the <strong>United Mexican States</strong>
        without regard to conflict‑of‑law rules. All disputes shall be resolved exclusively in the competent courts of
        Mexico City.</p>

    <h2>16. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>Developer may modify these Terms at any time. Material changes will be announced in-App, via the App Store
        "What's New" notes, or other reasonable means. Continued use after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of
        the modified Terms.</p>
